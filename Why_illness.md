<center><h1>Why call addiction a disease?</h1><center>

Well, first, what’s a disease? Here’s the answer I got from dictionary.com:

<i> a disordered or incorrectly functioning organ, part, structure, or system of the body resulting from the effect of genetic or developmental errors, infection, poisons, nutritional deficiency or imbalance, toxicity, or unfavorable environmental factors; illness; sickness; ailment.</i>

See that first line, “disordered or incorrectly functioning organ…” That’s where the trouble has been all these years. What we see when we look at an addict isn’t a broken leg or a fever or a rash; what we see is behavior we don’t like. So, instead of thinking of addiction as a disease or illness, we’ve been thinking of it as just a set of behaviors, a moral problem. Even when doctors finally realized it was an illness, most of society couldn’t believe it because we couldn’t show them the broken organ. Part of what I want to accomplish in this book is to show you the broken organ so that you can understand that addiction is a disease and that it has a good treatment.
