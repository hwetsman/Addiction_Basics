<center><h1>Can you be addicted to something good?</h1></center>

As soon as we start talking about good and bad we’ve left medicine and science and entered the world of moral judgments. I just don’t have any data on moral judgments, so you’ll have to decide for yourself what’s good and bad. Now if what you mean by “good” is “good for you,” I may have something to say.

Many people ask me if it’s okay to switch to being addicted to exercise because it’s so good for them. Well, moderate exercise is good for you; compulsive over-doing it isn’t. Just as you might have heard that a drink a day is heart healthy, but heavy drinking isn’t good for you. So I’d like you to let go of the idea that the drug or behavior is good or bad. It’s not the drug or behavior but rather the way it is used that determines the harmful consequences. In that light anything used to feed the disease of addiction won’t be good for you in the long run.

Several of my patients told me they were able to stop using the drug that was troublesome only to gain 70 pounds or lose thousands at the casino. That doesn’t do anyone any good. The key is to treat the underlying illness not just switch to something you think is a safe drug. In addiction, no drug stays safe for long.
