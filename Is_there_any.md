<h1><center>Is there any medical way to raise your dopamine receptor density?</center></h1>

Yes, there is. Recent studies<a name="ref12" href="#foot12">[12]</a> have been done where the gene for the dopamine receptor has been injected into the Medial Forebrain Bundle of a rodent that shows a preference for alcohol. The dopamine receptor gene turns out more dopamine receptors, the level rises, and the animal stops drinking as much alcohol.

So what’s the catch? The effect doesn’t last; it works for about 10 days. So if you’re looking for an easier softer way than being honest with yourself and going to AA meetings, all you have to do is get a brain injection every 10 days. And if that sounds like a good idea, then you can still hear your disease talking to you.
