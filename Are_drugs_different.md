<h1><center>Are drugs different from other rewards?</center></h1>

Well, that’s the real question, isn’t it? If addiction is limited to drugs, then drugs should be different from other rewards. But if research shows that drugs aren’t different from other rewards, it makes it hard to see how addiction with drugs is different from addiction with any other reward.

In 2004<a name="ref17" href="#foot17">[17]</a> a group of researchers used micro-electronics to monitor anywhere from one to four brain cells inside the Nucleus Accumbens of rats that were exposed to rewards. They used both cocaine and water.

How can water be a reward? Remember this system didn’t evolve to enjoy cocaine; it evolved to ensure the survival of the individual. When you’re thirsty, water is supposed to be pretty rewarding. Otherwise we wouldn’t drink it.

They found two interesting things. Both water and cocaine showed the same firing pattern in the Nucleus Accumbens, and, perhaps more interestingly, that different cells inside the Nucleus Accumbens responded to cocaine than those that responded to water. So it seems like the brain sets aside a few neurons that respond to one drug or another, but the firing pattern in the Nucleus Accumbens is the same regardless of the reward used.

Other researchers found that food, water, and sugar gave a similar pattern of response.<a name="ref18" href="#foot18">[18]</a> Still others<a name="ref19" href="#foot19">[19]</a> showed that while the patterns in the Nucleus Accumbens response is the same when cocaine and heroin are compared, the cells that responded differed just the way they did when cocaine was compared to water.

So difference in rewards doesn’t really seem to matter, and that makes sense if you think in evolutionary terms. Would we end up designed to respond to drugs that haven’t been invented yet or come from plants that don’t grow where we live? Not likely. However, we need to be able to know what’s good for us and to do those things that are good for us without thinking about them. We need to drink when we’re thirsty and eat when we’re hungry, and we need to be able to do those things automatically so that we don’t have to spend a lot of time thinking about whether we should do them or not. That’s why the Nucleus Accumbens does what it does, not so that people can get high on drugs. The reward system is there so that we can find things rewarding and do them unconsciously. Unfortunately, some of us don’t have reward systems that work right for one reason or another, so we don’t get rewarded by the little things. For that group it takes a bigger signal and the things that give us the signal are that much more important because the signal is all the more rare.
