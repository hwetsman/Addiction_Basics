<h1><center>Where is addiction in the brain?</center></h1>

Well, it kind of depends on what you mean by addiction. I’ll give you the whole thing and let you figure out what part you are interested in.

Earlier we discussed the reward center of the brain, and I showed you the dopamine-enkephalin feedback loop. That’s the biology of the compulsive use part of addiction. Before we go on to another part though, there’s something I want to add.



As you can see in the diagram both the NA and the VTA have inputs that use a neurotransmitter called GABA. Specifically they both have on their surfaces a special type of GABA receptor called GABA receptor b (GABAb). When the GABAb receptor is stimulated, it is more difficult for that cell to fire and send a signal. Think of it as a kind of dimmer switch. Energy is still going through, just not as much. So the cycle doesn’t go so far out of control. This may not seem relevant right now but it will be later when we talk about treatment.

Well that’s it for compulsive use. What about withdrawal? Withdrawal doesn’t happen in the same place, and I’ll tell you how I know that. If you insert a small micro catheter into the Medial Forebrain Bundle (MFB) of a mammal and hook it up to a drug, let’s say heroin, the animal will be happy to self inject the drug all the time. Now he’s only getting a little bit; so little, in fact, that it’s only going to the MFB. The rest of the brain can’t see it. So let’s say you let him self inject a few hours every day for weeks and weeks. Now stop the heroin. What happens? No withdrawal. So the MFB handles compulsive use but not withdrawal.

Quite a long ways away (a few inches is a very long way when you’re the size of a brain cell) is another part of the brain called the Periaqueductal Gray (PG). If you put a micro catheter in the PG, an animal won’t self administer drug a there. Even a Lewis rat won’t self administer a drug to the PG. No one would, because there’s no reward. So obviously the PG doesn’t have anything to do with compulsive use. However if you inject the drug, let’s say heroin, every day into the animal’s PG, then the PG can get exposed to the drug as if the animal was compulsively using. Now after several weeks you stop doing it. The animal goes into withdrawal. So the PG is no compulsive use, but a lot of withdrawal and the MFB is no withdrawal, but a lot of compulsive use.

Well, we covered compulsive use and withdrawal. What else is there? Relapse.
Before I tell you about the relapse circuit, I should mention that there are relapses associated with both of the areas we talked about already. Obviously if someone is in withdrawal they will use to prevent withdrawal, and if they are walking around with a low dopamine in the MFB, restless, irritable, and discontented, they are prone to relapse just to feel better. But I want to describe a different kind of relapse, the “out-of-the-blue” relapse.

The out-of-the-blue relapse comes from a signal using a neurotransmitter called glutamate. The glutamate is sent to the MFB from the area of the brain that remembers emotions. It’s what people have experienced as “euphoric recall,” and it’s a very powerful trigger. Imagine an alcoholic has been sober for a good while, and then he goes to a wedding. Everybody’s drinking, he gets euphoric recall and, even though he went to the wedding intending not to drink, he orders a drink. It’s important to know that this kind of relapse is real because there are medicines used to block this type of trigger by modulating down the glutamate signal.
In summary, there are three parts of the brain in addiction: compulsive use, withdrawal, and relapse. They need to be taken into account separately and at different time intervals in deciding what medication would be of help.
