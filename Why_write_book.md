<center><h1>Why did you write a book?</h1></center>

Addiction is a subject that brings up a lot of emotions that usually come from what we learned about addiction early in life. Even among people who learned about addiction in school you’ll find far more influence on their opinions from what they learned at home than what they learned at school.

What I saw in my patients, who got better and who got worse, was telling me something much different from what I’d learned about addiction in school. The ideas I learned in school didn’t seem to fit when the goal was getting people better. The definitions of addiction I had learned didn’t seem to be the same ones that my patients were experiencing.

Since what I learned about addiction was not helping many of my patients, I started carefully looking at those patients who were recovering successfully. I noticed something that the successful patients had in common. They had gotten involved in 12-step recovery. It didn’t seem to matter what they were addicted to or what 12-step recovery group they went to; the patients who were in 12-step recovery did better as a group than the ones who weren’t. So what was it about 12-step recovery that worked? Was it something I could replicate in my work with patients?

About the same time I heard a lecture about the brain’s reward system that finally made sense to me. What if addictions weren’t different from each other? What if heroin addiction was the same as alcoholism? What if there was a core problem that all my addicted patients had that was the same even though they looked so different from each other on the outside? What if 12-step recovery worked on that core problem and that’s why it didn’t matter what addiction someone had once they got into recovery? 

That’s a lot of questions. And it took a lot of reading and time to fit all the pieces of the puzzle together. I may not have everything right, but it makes sense to me. Before, when I followed what I had learned in school, addicts were hard if not impossible to treat. Now it’s all I do and it’s not so hard. Before, not many people got well. Now I have more success.

Most patients I meet are as confused about this disease as I was. They grew up in the same society I did with the same misconceptions about what addiction is, what it means, and how to live if you have it. So I wrote this book to get the explanation out as far as I could.

I won’t say that everything in this book is right. All I can tell you is that it’s true for me. With this information my patients do better. Frankly, I’m tired of the academic arguing about who’s right and who’s wrong. What matters is that people recover and get their lives back.
