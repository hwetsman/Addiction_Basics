<h1><center>What are Type I and Type II addiction?</center></h1>

Back in 1987 a researcher named Cloninger proposed a classification of two types of alcoholism<a name="ref9" href="#foot9">[9]</a>. With great imagination, he named them as Type I and Type II. Anyway, he said that Type I represented the majority of alcoholics and that it was characterized by four things:

1.	late onset (after age 25)
2.	low degree of spontaneous alcohol seeking
3.	psychological dependence coupled with guilt and fear
4.	and a low degree of novelty seeking and a high degree of harm avoidance.

That was a pretty astute observation, and, of course, Type II alcoholism was just the reverse: early onset, novelty seeking, and a lot of spontaneous alcohol seeking and not much guilt or fear. What Cloninger didn’t know about back in 1987 was the dopamine reward system of the Medial Forebrain Bundle. If you take a look at these types through the dopamine system, what you see is what you would expect to see from people who had too much dopamine (type I) and too little dopamine (type II). To understand these types better we have to leave humans for a bit and head off with some rat researchers.

It turns out that rats, regular rats that is, don’t really like drinking alcohol. It burns. So to get a rat in a lab to drink alcohol you have to do what the liquor industry did for my generation; you have to make a wine cooler. You add sugar to the alcohol, and the rats liking for sugar overcomes its dislike for alcohol and it eventually will drink the stuff.

So you start by adding a little sugar and a few of the rats will drink it. As you add more and more sugar, more and more rats will start drinking. Eventually you’ll add enough sugar so that only the very few rats that are most averse to alcohol will not have started drinking. If you line these rats up in the order they started drinking you get the scientific bell shaped curve (see below). Now you take the rats on the right of the curve (they like alcohol the least) and mate the males and females together. You do the same for the rats on the left of the curve (they dislike alcohol the least). Now you have two new sets of rats --those descended from the left hand of the curve and those descended from the right hand side of the curve. With each of those two groups you do the same experiment, each time taking the extreme right or left and mating them together to make yet another group. So in each generation you get a bell shaped curve, but the curves get farther and farther apart. After about 14 or 15 generations you now have two new strains of rats.

Those rats descended from the right hand side of the curve don’t like alcohol at all. They won’t self administer drugs. They just don’t see the point. The rats descended from the left hand side of the curve are very different. They’ll drink straight lab alcohol with no sugar. They love self administering drugs.

The first group is the Fisher rats and the second group is the Lewis rats<a name="ref10" href="#foot10">[10]</a>. When you take a look at the brains of the Lewis rats what you see is a dopamine system that isn’t healthy. There’s not enough dopamine signal to feel normal, and they are looking for every source of dopamine they can find. Think of these as Type II’s. On the other hand, the Fisher rats have more dopamine receptors than normal, so any extra dopamine actually makes them feel bad. They don’t like it and won’t use it. Think of them as Type I’s for a while.

Now I said that the Fisher rats won’t use drugs and that’s true, but you can change that if you want. Let’s say you force the drugs on them by putting in a catheter and pumping them full of, say, heroin or cocaine, the way the Lewis rat would take it. Every time they get the hit, some damage is done to the dopamine system because the drug is just “too much.” Remember the fuse that blows to protect the house from lightning? So after a while they have less and less dopamine until, at some point, they no longer act like Fisher rats but start acting like Lewis rats.

Now it’s time to realize that this experiment was first done by nature and we were the subjects. Some of us were born as Lewis rats and some as Fisher rats, but most of us were born in the middle. For the “Lewis” people, I pretty much think the die was cast. They were going to find the dopamine no matter where they had to look.

For most of the “Fisher” people, everything might have been okay except that too much dopamine actually makes us nervous and we seek relief from the anxiety. Alcohol and downers are good for that, and Type I’s tend to prefer those. Of course every time a Type I person drinks or uses downers, there’s that same boost of dopamine in the reward center even though there’s too much dopamine in the “anxiety centers” of the brain. After a while they have too little dopamine in the reward centers and start to look for alcohol and drugs even without the anxiety.

My clinical experience is different from Cloninger’s. Most, about 80%, of the people I talk to with addiction are Type II’s. Type I’s are not that common in my practice. Back in the 80’s people thought alcoholism and drug addiction were two different things, so when they studied alcoholics, they tried to get a pure population. They excluded those alcoholics who used other drugs. If you do that you will get a population over-represented by Type I’s, and I think that’s what happened with Cloninger’s research.
